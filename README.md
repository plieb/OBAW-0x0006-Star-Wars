1. Click the button **New Bot** and define the bot as follows

    - Bot Name: Salesforce Bot

1. Get back to your Bot Connector account and add a Messenger channel. Give it a name and follow step 1 to 4 in order to get your **Secret Key** & **Page Token**

## Step 5: Get your Recast bot

1. Make sure you are logged in to your [Recast.AI account](https://recast.ai/)
1. Follow this link [Salesforce DreamHouse bot](https://recast.ai/pe/salesforce-dreamhouse/learn) and fork the bot to your account
1. Copy paste your `bot request access token` in the **Config Variables** section of your Heroku app to `RE_BOT_TOKEN`
1. You're all set !

## Next steps ideas :

1. Implement `createLead` in salesforce.js when client select a house
1. Enrich the bot to understand more small talk intents
1. Implement `prediction.io` for recommendations
